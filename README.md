# Mission-to-Mars
Module 11 Challenge

Robin was recently hired as a data analyst at SpaceForward (a fictitious company). SpaceForward is an ambitious aerospace company that’s doing research about resource extraction from nearby planets. Robin has been tasked with gathering information about the climate of Mars. She’s also been asked to collect news items about Mars missions. Although some of this information isn’t readily available in either CSV or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files or through APIs, it can be found on public websites.
 

Fortunately, Robin knows of a way to collect and organize web data into a usable database: web scraping.
